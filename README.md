# TinyBit

A work in progress programming language.

Why did I decide to start making this?

Well, I wanted to understand how abstract syntax trees work, so I started reading numerous documentation pages, and guides,
and eventually followed a guide that taught how to build a "basic" (the programming language) interpreter.

This project wasn't really focused on the language, but rather learning how ASTs work.
